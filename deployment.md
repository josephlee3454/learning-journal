# vercel
* The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform from the creators of Next.js. Vercel is an all-in-one platform with Global CDN supporting static & Jamstack deployment and Serverless Functions.
# DPS: Develop, Preview, Ship
* Develop: Write code in Next.js. Keep the development server running and take advantage of React Fast Refresh.
* Preview: Every time you push changes to a branch on GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket, Vercel automatically creates a new deployment with a unique URL. You can view them on GitHub when you open a pull request, or under “Preview Deployments” on your project page on Vercel. Learn more about it here.
* Ship: When you’re ready to ship, merge the pull request to your default branch (e.g. master). Vercel will automatically create a production deployment.
# Optimized for Next.js
* Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js and has first-class support for Next.js.

* For example, the hybrid pages approach is fully supported out of the box.

* Every page can either use Static Generation or Server-Side Rendering.
* Pages that use Static Generation and assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc) will automatically be served from the Vercel's Edge Network, which is blazingly fast.
* Pages that use Server-Side Rendering and API routes will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions. This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely.
