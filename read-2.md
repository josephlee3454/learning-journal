# Python Modules
## Modular programming 
* The process of breaking down larger unweilding programs into smaller  and more manageble modules.
### advantages
#### simplicity 
* instead of dealing with the entire problem at once modules typically focus on smalle3r portions of the problem domain. the smaller the problem the simplier bthe problem is to wrap your head around
#### maintainability 
* modules are typically designed to enforce logical boundraies between different problem domains. if modules re written to minimize interdependency which will decrease the likelihood  that modifications to a single module will have impact on other parts of the app.
#### resuability 
* if done right funtionanility defined in a single module can easily be reused this should eliminate the need to duplicate cdode. 
#### scoping 
* modules typically define a seperate name space which will help avoid collisions 
# Recursion
* process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.
