# How javascript makes web pages more interactive
1. Access content
* yoyu can use javaScript to select nany element,attribute, or text from an html page 
2. Modify content 
* you can use JavaScript to add elements, atttributes, and text to the page, or remove them.
3. program rules 
* you can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page.
4. React to events
* you can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occured.
## Expressions 
* An Expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. broadly speaking there are two types.
1. expressions that just assign a value to a varible
* var color = 'biege';
##### in order for the varible to work it needs to be assignecd an operator (eqaul sign) so in this example the value of the color is biege 
2. Expessions that use two or more values to return a single value 
* var area = 3 * 2 ;
##### you can perform operations on any number of individual values to determine a single value in this example the value of the area is now 6
## Operators
* Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value
## Assignment operators
* color = 'biege';
##### value of color is now beige
## Arithmetic operators
*area = 3 * 2;
##### value of are is now 6
## string operators 
* greeting = 'Hi' + 'Molly';
# Functions
* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.
##### example

###### function sayhello(){
######    document.write('hello!')
###### }
