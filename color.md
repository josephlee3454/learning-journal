## backround color 
* Css treats each html element as if it appears in a box, so when we use the backround color element it basically sets the color for the backround for that box.

###### Hex codes 
* As you can see each line of code has where its going, and has the brackets around the whole line with a semi colon before every closing bracket and inbetween the brackets you have backround-color
## opacity
* Opacity(rgba) pretty much means your adding a another element to the rgb line of code to make the color thinner or thicker which means you can make anything see through
