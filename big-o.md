#  Big 0
* used in software development  to describe the complexity of the problem you are trying to solve
## O(N)
* this describes the algorithm whose performance grows linearly and direct porportion to the size of the input data 
## O(N^2)
* this represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the sqaure size of the data set. very common with algorithms that involve nestted iterations over the data set (nested for loops)
## 0(2^n)
* denotes an algorithm whose growth wil double with ea ch set of data.
## logarithims O(log N)
* The iterative halving of data sets described in the binary search example produces a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase e.g. an input data set containing 10 items takes one second to complete, a data set containing 100 items takes two seconds, and a data set containing 1000 items will take three seconds
* this is derectly from the article i didnt know how eles to explain it yet ("https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/")

# pain
* the main thing i took away from the artiucle about pain was that learning new things is not easy especially at the rate we do it at codefellows. So there will be pain but thats ok because the pain is while uncomfortable the best way to learn. s
