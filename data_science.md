# Data science in a nutshell
* data science in a nut shell is the act of trying to make  sense of data by identifying patterns, applying algorithiums toi extract information and predict future actions that are suitable for a specific situation 
## Unstructured Data:
* it does not have an already predefined data model. (it can be audio, video, and text format)

## Structured Data:
* it is mostly availble in a a text format which originates from databases or specific fiule formats CSV(Common Seperated Values)

# NumPy 
* which stands for Numerical python it is a library consisting of multiidmensional array objects and a collection of routines for porocessing those arrays

# NumPy - Rplacement for MatLab 
* NumPy is often used along with packages like SciPy and Mat-potlib. The combination is widley used as a replacement for MatLab 

# Operations using NumPy 
* mathmatical and logical operations on arrays 
* Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation 
* operations related to ;linear algebra. Nyumpoy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.
