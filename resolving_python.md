# scope
## concept of scope
* the concept of scope rules how varibles and names are looked up in your code.
# LEGB
* strands for local enclosing global and built in scopes
## global scope 
* thae names that you define in this scope are availble to al your code.
## local scope 
* names that are only locally scoped within code you cant use this over other functions
# buiult in scope 
* The built-in scope is a special Python scope that’s implemented as a standard library module named builtins in Python 3.x. All of Python’s built-in objects live in this module. They’re automatically loaded to the built-in scope when you run the Python interpreter. Python searches builtins last in its LEGB lookup, so you get all the names it defines for free. This means that you can use them without importing any module.
