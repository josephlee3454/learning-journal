* it was interesting to see that most of the big tech companies all have their own issuses with hiring people of diverse backrounds.
* for example most of them try to hire diverse people but its not because it seems like they hire one diverse group instead of all groups. if you take twitter they have a higher number in asian male workers working there than most but a very low number of women work there. it makes me think they dont try do this but it happens because people fall into a routine of hiring people that they are familar with because if you look at just about every company there numbers are each different instead of being balanced they are hire one or two major groups.
