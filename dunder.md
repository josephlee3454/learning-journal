# what are dunder methods 
* are special methods that are apart of a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. for example __init__ 0r __str__
## python data model
* lets developers tap into rich langauge features like sequences, iteration , operatir overloading, attribute access.

## object initilization: __init__
* the first method you will probally use is the dunder init think of this like a constructor.

## object representation
* __repr__:  the is used to make the official string representation for the object.
* __str__: the informal or nicely printable string representation

## iterators and dunder
* __len__: returns the length of an object
* __getitem__: its magic it allows its instances to use index operators 
* __reversed__: returns reverse iterator


# what is probability
* At the most basic level, probability seeks to answer the question, â€œWhat is the chance of an event happening?
[link](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/basic-statistics-in-python-probability/) 
* the event is the outcome of interest to calculate this chance of the event happening we need to consider all the other events that can occur. one representation of this happening is a coin toss the events that can happen are flipping heads or flipping tails.
* these two events form the sample space(the set of all possibile events that can happen.)
