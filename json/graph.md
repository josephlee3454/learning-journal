# graphs
* A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.
* Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
* Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
* Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
* Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
Directed vs Undirec
### Undirected Graphs
* An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
### Directed Graphs (Digraph)
* A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.
Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.
