# Remote repsitory
* to achieve collaboration on git projects you must interact w/remote rpositories versions of a project 
residing online or on a network. teams can also use this to push and pull data from it.


## so what we will cover is how to push and pull data so you can see or add to temamtes work

(owner$ cd codefellows
#### codefellows$ ls
### 102
### codefellows$ cd 102
### 102$ ls
### pojects
### 102$ cd pojects
### pojects$ ls
### learning-journal
### pojects$ cd learning-journal
### learning-journal[master ?]$ git status
### On branch master
### Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

### Untracked files:
 ### (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

    remote

### nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
learning-journal[master ?]$)

* As you can see we are up to date with (origin master) which is where we pulled the code from to the editor
* but if somebody decide they wanted to change lets say a teamate you would have to pull 
* but if you make the changes you will have to push the info to get the code to (origin master)
