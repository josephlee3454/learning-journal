# Modular programming
* is basically the breakdown of challenging programming tasks into seperate, smaller, more managable subtasks or modules.
# several adavantages to modularising are
* simplicity so rather than trying to think of the really challenging problem as a whole a module will typically focus on one relativly small portion of the problem
# maintainability 
* modules are typically designed to enforce logical boundries between problem domain. so that it dosnt affect other parts of the program to much.
# resuability
* functionality when cdefined in a single module will be easy to reuse 
# scoping
* modules typically define a seperate namespace which helps avoid collisions between identifiers in different areas of a program.
