# comparison operators and evauluating conditions
### you can evaluate na situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: true or false
##### examples 
## ==
#### is eqaul to 
* this operator compares 2 values
numbers, strings, or booleans)
## != 
#### is equal to
* this operator compares 2 values (numbers, strings, or booleans) to see if they are not the same 
## ===
### strict equal to
this operator compares 2 values to check that both the data type and value are the same
## !== 
### strict not equal to 
* this operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same 
## > 
### Greater Than
* this operator checks if the number on the left is greater then the number on the right 
## <
### Greater Than 
* this operator checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right 
## >= 
### greater then or eqaul to 
* this operator checks if the number on the left is less than or eqaul to the number on the right 
# Logical operators
## &&
### logical and 
* this operator tests more than one condition 
## ||
### logical or
* this op0erator tests at least one condition
## !
### logical not 
* this operator takes a single boolesan value and iunverts it 
# LOOPS!
* loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. bThen the condition will be checked again and it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. there are three common types of loops 
## For 
* if you need to run code a specific number of times, use a for loop. (it is the most common loop/.) in a for loop, the condition is usaully a counter which used to tel;l how many times the loop should run. 
## While 
* if you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a while loop. Here the condition can be something other thenm a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true. 
## Do while 
* the bdo...while loop is very similar to the while loop, but has one key difference; it will always run the statements inside the curly brace at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.

# Loop counters 
* a for loop uses a counter as a condition. This instructs the code to run a specified nummber of times. bhere you can see the condition is made up of three statements 
## Initialization 
* Create a varible and set it to 0. this varible is commonly caslled i, and it acts a counter
## condition 
* the looop should continue to run until the counter reaches a specified number.
## update 
* every time the loop has run the statements in the curly bracesw, it adds one to the counter
