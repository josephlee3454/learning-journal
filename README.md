*Growth mindset*
- the ability to mentally adapt and overcome obstacles that you might encounter while learning new skills


Ways to stay in the growth mindset 
- Dont ask for the answer but ask how to get the answer 
- reflect on everything that led you to that point and give yourself credit
- remeber the *end goal* 


Words that are not allowed 
- ~~give up~~
- ~~i cant do this~~
- ~~this is to hard~~
