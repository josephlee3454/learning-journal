# Growth mindset
- The ability to mentally **adapt and overcome** obstacles that you might encounter while learning new skills


Ways to stay in the growth mindset 
- Dont ask for the answer but ask how to get the answer 
- reflect on everything that led you to that point and give yourself credit
- remeber the *end goal* 


Words that are not *allowed* 
1. ~~give up~~
2. ~~i cant do this~~
3. ~~this is to hard~~
